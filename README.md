# Bigraph Toolkit Suite

Welcome to Bigraph Toolkit Suite, a collection of projects designed to provide tools, framework and libraries for working with bigraphs, bigraphical reactive systems and related technologies. 

Explore the projects of Bigraph Toolkit Suite below:

## Repository Overview

### Bigraph Framework

- **Description**: A framework written in Java for the creation and simulation of bigraphs. It contains converters, basic means for visualization, and file-based persistence. A basic model checker for bigraphical reactive systems is also included.
- **Type:** Framework
- **GitHub Repository**: [bigraphs.bigraph-framework Repository](https://github.com/bigraph-toolkit-suite/bigraphs.bigraph-framework)

### Bigraph Ecore Metamodel

- **Description**: This project serves as a reference implementation of an abstract syntax specification for bigraphs.
- **Type:** Specification
- **GitHub Repository**: [bigraphs.bigraph-ecore-metamodel Repository](https://github.com/bigraph-toolkit-suite/bigraphs.bigraph-ecore-metamodel)

### Bigellor

- **Description**: Bigellor is a web-based editor for the visual modeling of bigraphs.
- **Type:** IDE
- **GitHub Repository**: [bigraphs.ide.bigellor Repository](https://github.com/bigraph-toolkit-suite/bigraphs.ide.bigellor)

### Spring Data CDO

- **Description**: Spring repository support for Connected Data Objects (CDO), a distributed shared model of Eclipse EMF.
- **Type:** Spring-based Framework
- **GitHub Repository**: [spring-data-cdo Repository](https://github.com/bigraph-toolkit-suite/spring-data-cdo)

### GrGen.NET  and Bigraphs

- **Description**: BiGGer is a transformation tool and library that translates bigraphical models and rules to GrGen.NET-compatible files. It enables bigraph rewriting using GrGen.NET.
- **Type:** Library, command-line tool
- **GitHub Repository**: [bigraphs.grgen-bigraphs Repository](https://github.com/bigraph-toolkit-suite/bigraphs.grgen-bigraphs)

### BigRed Core Model
- **Description**: Big Red is a graphical development environment for bigraphs, and this project contains only the core bigraph model of Big Red.
- **Type:** Library
- **GitHub Repository**: [bigraphs.bigred-core Repository](https://github.com/bigraph-toolkit-suite/bigraphs.bigred-core)
