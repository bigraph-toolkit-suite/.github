## Constitution for the Bigraph Toolkit Community Group

### 1. Name

The group shall be called the **Bigraph Toolkit Suite Community Group** (hereinafter ‚Äúthe Group‚Äù).

### 2. Purpose

The aims of the Group are:

- To foster research and development of reactive systems using bigraph theory, a formalism for modelling and reasoning about dynamic, distributed systems.
- To develop, maintain and expand the **Bigraph Toolkit Suite (BTS)**, which provides tools and frameworks for designing and implementing verified reactive and distributed architectures with integrated model‚Äëchecking capabilities.
- To provide a forum for collaboration, peer learning and sharing of knowledge among people interested in bigraphs and reactive systems.
- To promote openness, inclusivity and ethical research practices within the community.

### 3. Membership

- Membership is open to anyone who supports the aims of the Group and participates in its activities.
- There is no membership fee. A person becomes a member by either:
  - **Expressing their intent to participate**, for example by contacting the Group or its Owner, particularly as:
    - an **Outside Collaborator** (individuals or organizations providing advice, infrastructure, or resources), or
    - an **Organization Member** (individuals strongly affiliated and involved in BTS); **or**
  - **Actively participating** in the community as an **Active Contributor** (e.g., through pull requests, issue reporting, or discussion).
- A membership list shall be maintained so that members can be contacted about meetings and decisions.
- A member may cease to be a member at any time by notifying any member of the Group. A member who has not participated in any Group activities for two years may be deemed to have resigned. This does not imply exclusion; anyone is welcome to rejoin at any time by resuming participation or expressing interest.


### 4. Governance

The Group is self-governed by its participating members. 
Decisions are made through **lazy consensus**:

- As per the [Apache-style definition](https://community.apache.org/committers/decisionMaking.html), a member may propose actions or changes by stating them publicly (e.g., via issue tracker, or pull request). If no objections are raised within a specified period (typically 72 hours), the proposal is considered accepted‚Äîsilence implies consent.
- Proposals may be implemented after a brief additional grace period, provided no objections are raised.
- If objections are raised‚Äîwith valid concerns‚Äîthe proposal is revised or further discussion is encouraged.
- Formal votes are reserved for decisions impacting legal or strategic aspects, such as project reorganization or external agreements.

### 5. Roles & Decision Authority

1. **All members may propose actions:** Because the Group is small and run by volunteers, its members collectively act as the management committee. Responsibilities such as chairing meetings, taking minutes or coordinating activities may be rotated among members.
2. **If consensus cannot be reached through lazy consensus,** a formal vote may be conducted. The voting mechanism can be initiated via a subject line like `[VOTE]` and following the Apache guidelines.
3. **The Group does not assign formal titles** ‚Äî roles evolve organically based on contribution and participation.

### 6. Equal Opportunities

The Group will not discriminate on the grounds of sex, race (including colour, ethnic or national origin), sexual orientation, disability, gender reassignment, religious or political belief, pregnancy or maternity, marital status or age.

### 7. Amendments to the Constitution

This constitution may be amended using lazy consensus. Proposed amendments are shared via the same channels and, if unobjected within 72 hours, become effective. Objections or counter-proposals will be discussed, and a formal vote may be held if consensus cannot be reached.
